**Effortlessly manage and synchronize your content across TikTok, Instagram Reels, and X (formerly Twitter).**

CreatorSync is a web platform designed to streamline the workflow for content creators who publish across multiple short-form video and social media platforms. It provides a centralized dashboard to manage, schedule, and analyze content performance, saving creators time and helping them maintain a consistent online presence.

## The Problem

Managing content across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X is time-consuming and fragmented. Creators face challenges such as:

*   Manually uploading the same content multiple times.
*   Inconsistent posting schedules.
*   Difficulty tracking performance metrics across different platforms.
*   Maintaining brand consistency.

## The Solution: CreatorSync

CreatorSync aims to solve these problems by offering:

*   **Centralized Content Hub:** Upload and manage all your video and text content in one place.
*   **Multi-Platform Scheduling:** Plan and schedule posts for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and X from a single calendar.
*   **Unified Analytics:** View key performance indicators (views, likes, comments, engagement rate) aggregated from all connected platforms.
*   **(Planned) Direct Publishing:** Publish content directly to connected platforms (subject to API availability and terms).
*   **Profile Management:** Manage your CreatorSync profile and settings.

## Key Features (Implemented & Planned)

*   **Authentication:** Secure user login and registration.
*   **Dashboard:** Overview of recent activity, scheduled posts, and key metrics.
*   **Content Management:** View, upload, edit, and organize content.
*   **Content Creation Form:** Detailed form for adding new content with platform-specific options.
*   **User Profile Page:** View and manage user details.
*   **Settings Page:** Configure account preferences and potentially connect social accounts (planned).
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizations of content performance across platforms.
*   **Pricing Page:** Information on subscription tiers (if applicable).
*   **(Planned) Notification System:** Alerts for scheduled posts, performance milestones, etc.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd CreatorSync
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Authentication (Email/Password provider), Firestore, and Cloud Storage.
    *   Get your Firebase project configuration keys (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
    *   Copy the `.env.local.example` (if provided, otherwise create `.env.local`) and populate it with your Firebase configuration keys:
        ```plaintext
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
        ```

4.  **Set up Firebase Emulators (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Install the Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
    *   Install Java JDK (required by Firebase Emulators) and ensure it's in your system PATH.
    *   Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
    *   Start the emulators: `firebase emulators:start`
    *   The app is configured to connect to emulators automatically when run in development mode (`npm run dev`).

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

*   Run unit and integration tests:
    ```bash
    npm test
    # or
    yarn test
    ```
*   (Requires Emulators Running) Run tests interacting with emulated Firebase services.
*   (Setup Needed) Run End-to-End tests:
    ```bash
    npm run cypress:open
    # or
    yarn cypress:open
    ```
