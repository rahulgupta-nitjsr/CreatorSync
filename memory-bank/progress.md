## Current Development Status (End of Phase 3 Functionality)

Phase 1 (Foundation) is complete. Phase 2 (Core Features) structural framework and placeholders are complete. Phase 3 (Publishing Trigger, Scheduling, Basic Engagement/Analytics) core functionality is now implemented.

**Key Blockers / Items Requiring External Input or Setup:**
1.  **Platform API Keys/Secrets:** Required to implement actual OAuth connections and content publishing.
2.  **Testing:** Requires dedicated effort to fix existing issues and build out comprehensive coverage.
3.  **Firebase Admin SDK Credentials:** Secure setup of the service account key environment variable for local development without emulators or for specific deployment environments.

**Next Technical Steps:**
1.  **Testing:** Address existing test issues and implement comprehensive test coverage (Unit, Integration, E2E).
2.  **Platform API Implementation:** Integrate actual platform APIs within the existing placeholders (OAuth, Content Publishing).
3.  **Content Editing:** Implement data loading and saving logic for the Edit Content page.
4.  **Deployment:** Configure CI/CD and deploy the application and Cloud Functions.
5.  **Refinements:** Address UI/UX polish, advanced error handling, and performance optimizations.
