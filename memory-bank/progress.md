## Current Development Status

**CRITICAL BLOCKER:** The **Firebase Emulators require Java** to be installed and available in the system PATH. The error "Could not spawn `java -version`" prevents their use. **Resolving this Java dependency is the immediate priority** to enable local integration testing (Firestore rules, Cloud Functions, etc.) and proceed with further backend development.

The Firebase Emulator Suite has been successfully configured for local development and testing. Security rules have been implemented for Firestore and Storage, and the necessary configuration files have been created. The emulator connection has been integrated into the Firebase configuration.

All 'firestore' import errors have been fixed by updating the imports to use 'db' instead of 'firestore' across all service files. 

The authentication routing issue has been fixed by adding a layout file to the (auth) route group. This ensures that the authentication pages are properly accessible at their intended routes.

Comprehensive form validation has been implemented across all major forms in the application, including Login, Register, Forgot Password, Profile Settings, and Content Creation. Each form now has specific validation rules appropriate to its context, real-time error feedback, and improved user experience with automatic error clearing on input.

Context providers have been fully integrated throughout the application, with the AuthContext and NotificationsContext properly connected to all relevant components. The Navbar component now displays unread notification counts and allows marking all notifications as read. User profile information is consistently accessed through the Auth context, ensuring a single source of truth for user data across the application.

The Firebase emulators require Java to be installed on the system and available in the PATH. When attempting to start the emulators, an error was encountered: "Could not spawn `java -version`. Please make sure Java is installed and on your system PATH." This dependency will need to be addressed before the emulators can be used effectively. Despite this, the Next.js development server is running successfully at http://localhost:3000.
