- [x] Create test files for utilities (validation, errorHandling)
- [x] Create test files for services (auth, firestore, storage, notifications) with mocking
- [ ] **Revisit & Fix:** `useAuth` hook tests (`__tests__/hooks/useAuth.test.tsx`) - Requires debugging complex mocking issues with Firebase listeners in Jest/Next.js environment.
- [ ] **Expand Coverage:** Add tests for remaining components, pages (Dashboard, Create, Edit, Settings), and potentially integration tests.

## Phase 2: Next Steps

- **Refinement & Polish:**
    - [ ] Improve loading indicators (e.g., spinners, skeletons).
    - [ ] Implement user-friendly notifications/toasts for success/error messages.
    - [ ] Enhance form validation feedback and edge cases.
    - [ ] Review and ensure consistent Timestamp/Date handling and display.
    - [ ] Add comprehensive accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
    - [ ] Optimize performance (code splitting, image optimization, query optimization).
- **Core Feature Expansion:**
    - [ ] Implement actual content publishing logic (integration with TikTok, Instagram, X APIs).
    - [ ] Implement platform connection flow (OAuth for TikTok, Instagram, X).
    - [ ] Implement platform disconnection flow.
    - [ ] Develop Content Studio features (advanced editing, scheduling options).
    - [ ] Implement basic Analytics display on Dashboard.
    - [ ] Implement basic Monetization tracking placeholders.
- **Testing:**
    - [ ] Fix failing `useAuth` tests.
    - [ ] Achieve target code coverage for Phase 1 features.
    - [ ] Set up Firebase Emulator testing for Firestore rules and backend logic.
    - [ ] Implement basic End-to-End tests (Cypress) for critical flows (Login, Create Content).
- **Infrastructure & Deployment:**
    - [ ] Set up GitHub repository and branch protection rules.
    - [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
    - [ ] Deploy Phase 1 to a staging environment.

## Current Development Status (End of Phase 1)

Phase 1 implementation is complete. The core application structure using Next.js App Router is established. Key features including user authentication, content creation (with file upload), content viewing, editing (metadata), deletion (including storage files), and viewing platform connection status are functional. The application integrates with Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage via a service layer and uses React Context for global state management (user auth, profile, connections). Basic UI components, layout, and routing are in place. Testing was initiated but paused to prioritize feature completion; existing tests cover utilities, services (mocked), and some components, but require revisiting and expansion, particularly for hooks involving Firebase listeners. The immediate next steps involve refining the existing features (UI polish, error handling, notifications), implementing the actual platform API integrations for publishing and connections, and resuming comprehensive testing efforts.
